# DeepLearning
This project is just a learning/practice of the techniques used in book Probabilitic Machine Learning. I would say it is my interpretaion of this book. I have modified the codes to try some more things on top of it.

Bidirectional RNN for sentiment classification with 3 classfication (pos/neg/unsupported)

Neural machine translation (NMT) using RNN bidirectional with Attention decoder (Added test based on bleu score with training)
